			<h1>Formatting Demo Page - 5</h1>
			<p>
			    This simple page demonstrates the formatting tags covered in this lesson
			</p>

		<div>
			<h2>Bold and Strong</h2>
			<p>
			    <span style=“bold”>This is bold Text</span>
			    
			    <!-- This is relative link -->
			    <a href="somewhere/somewhere.html">Go Somewhere</a>
			</p>
			<p>
			    The strong tag has the same visual effect as the bold tag but the strong tag also marks the enclosed text as more important. It is also easier for screen readers to read for the visually disabled.
